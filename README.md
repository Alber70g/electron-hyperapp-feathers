# Subscription-service

## Getting started

Install yarn globally, as it will speed up your `npm install` commands extensively.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies by running this in the directory `subscription-service`
```
yarn
```

Start the applications by running. This will run two commands concurrently. One for `frontend` and one for `backend`

```
yarn start
```
